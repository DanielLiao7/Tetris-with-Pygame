# Tetris-with-Pygame
A simple version of Tetris made using the Pygame module for python. This was submitted as my final project for CS121P Intro to Programming.

**Controls:**
Use arrow keys for movement and rotation, C for holding pieces, and SPACE for hard drops. 
ESC is used to pause the game.

Also features different color palettes accessible using the number keys(1-7).
